## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Node.js**: Version 16.x or higher (includes npm - Node Package Manager). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **Git**: For cloning the repository. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
* **MongoDB**: If you plan to run the backend and database locally. You can download it from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/). Alternatively, you can use a cloud MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas.
* A **code editor**: Visual Studio Code is highly recommended.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder-name>
   ```

### Backend Setup (Assumed)

Since the backend code is not provided in this context, these are general steps you would typically follow. Assume the backend code is in a `server` directory.

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory. This file will store sensitive information and configuration settings. Add the following (replace with your actual values):
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_erp_db_name
   JWT_SECRET=your_very_strong_jwt_secret_key
   # Add any other backend-specific environment variables
   ```
   * `PORT`: The port number the backend server will run on (e.g., 3000).
   * `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string.
   * `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication.

4. **Start the Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Or, if a development script is available (e.g., using `nodemon`):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The backend API should now be running (e.g., at `http://localhost:3000`).

### Frontend Setup

The frontend code is located in the `client` directory.

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd client # If you are in the root project folder
   # If you are in the server folder, use: cd ../client
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the Frontend Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will typically open the application in your default web browser. If not, navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or another port specified in your console, often 3001 or similar if 3000 is taken by the backend).

---

## 🏃 Running the Application

* **Backend**: Ensure your backend server is running (typically on `http://localhost:3000` as per API calls in the frontend).
* **Frontend**: Ensure your frontend development server is running (typically on `http://localhost:5173` or similar).

Open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL to start using the application.

## 🔄 Workflow Examples

### Authentication Flow
1. **User navigates to Login Page**: Enters credentials (email/password).
2. **Frontend sends credentials to Backend**: `POST /api/auth/login` (assumed).
3. **Backend validates credentials**:
   * If valid, generates a JWT (JSON Web Token) and sends it back.
   * If invalid, sends an error response.
4. **Frontend stores JWT**: Typically in `localStorage`.
5. **Authenticated Requests**: For subsequent API calls, the JWT is included in the `Authorization` header (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
6. **Logout**: JWT is removed from `localStorage`.

### Quotation Management Flow
1. **User navigates to Quotations Page**.
2. **Clicks "Create New Quotation"**.
3. **Fills Quotation Details**:
   * Sets date, validity date.
   * **Client Details**:
     * Searches for an existing client. If found, details are auto-filled and read-only.
     * If not found, enters new client details (Company Name, GST, Email, Phone) and clicks "Save New Client". This makes a `POST /api/clients` call.
   * **Goods Details**:
     * Searches for items using `ItemSearchComponent`.
     * Selects items to add. Item details (description, HSN, unit, price, max discount) are populated.
     * Adjusts quantity and price (if permissible within discount limits).
     * The system auto-calculates item amount, total quantity, total amount, GST, and grand total.
4. **Submits the Quotation**:
   * If creating: `POST /api/quotations`.
   * If editing: `PUT /api/quotations/:id`.
5. **View/Download PDF**: User can view the generated PDF of the quotation or download it.
6. **Create Ticket**: User can convert a quotation into a ticket, which pre-fills ticket data.

### User Management Flow (Super Admin)
1. **Super Admin logs in**.
2. **Navigates to User Management Page**. (Access is restricted; non-super-admins see an "Unauthorized" page).
3. **Views list of users**: Can search and paginate.
4. **Actions**:
   * **Add New User**: Fills form (firstname, lastname, email, phone, role, password) and saves. `POST /api/users`.
   * **Edit User**: Selects a user, modifies details (role cannot be changed for super-admin, email is read-only), and saves. `PUT /api/users/:id`.
   * **Delete User**: Selects a user and confirms deletion. `DELETE /api/users/:id`. (Super-admin users cannot be deleted).
   * **View User Details**: Opens a modal with comprehensive user information.
   * **Generate Report**: Opens a modal to view activity reports for a specific user.

---

## 🔗 Key API Endpoints (Frontend Perspective)

The frontend interacts with the following backend API endpoints (base URL: `http://localhost:3000`):

* **Authentication (Assumed)**:
  * `POST /api/auth/login`
  * `POST /api/auth/register`
* **Users**:
  * `GET /api/users`: Fetch all users.
  * `POST /api/users`: Create a new user.
  * `PUT /api/users/:id`: Update an existing user.
  * `DELETE /api/users/:id`: Delete a user.
* **Clients**:
  * `POST /api/clients`: Create a new client (used from quotation form).
  * `GET /api/clients`: (Implied for `ClientSearchComponent`).
* **Items**:
  * `GET /api/items`: (Implied for `ItemSearchComponent`).
* **Quotations**:
  * `GET /api/quotations`: Fetch all quotations (supports `?status=` filter).
  * `POST /api/quotations`: Create a new quotation.
  * `PUT /api/quotations/:id`: Update an existing quotation.
  * `DELETE /api/quotations/:id`: Delete a quotation.
* **Tickets**:
  * `POST /api/tickets`: Create a new ticket.
  * `GET /api/tickets/check/:quotationNumber`: Check if a ticket exists for a quotation.

---

## 📝 Logging

* **Frontend**: The application uses a custom `frontendLogger.js` utility.
  * Logs important activities, successful operations, and errors to the browser console.
  * Includes user information (if available) and contextual data with logs.
  * This is helpful for debugging and tracking user interactions during development and troubleshooting.
* **Backend**: (Assumed) Proper logging should be implemented on the backend (e.g., using Winston or Morgan) to record requests, errors, and significant events.

---

## ⚠️ Error Handling

* **User Feedback**:
  * `react-toastify` is used for non-blocking notifications (success, error, warning, info).
  * `react-bootstrap` Alerts are used for more prominent error messages within forms or page sections.
* **API Errors**:
  * Axios interceptors (or direct try-catch blocks) handle API response errors.
  * Specific handling for `401 Unauthorized` (e.g., redirect to login) and `403 Forbidden` (e.g., show "Unauthorized" page).
  * Server-side validation errors are displayed to the user.
* **Form Validation**:
  * Client-side validation using HTML5 attributes (`required`, `type`, `min`) and React Bootstrap's form validation.
  * Custom validation logic (e.g., for GST format, phone number, price discounts).

---

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

* **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for stateless authentication. Ensure `JWT_SECRET` is strong and kept confidential.
* **Authorization**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented. Backend must rigorously enforce these roles for all sensitive operations.
* **Input Validation**:
  * Client-side validation provides quick feedback but is not a security measure.
  * **Crucial**: Server-side validation must be implemented for all incoming data to prevent invalid data, injection attacks (e.g., NoSQL injection if using MongoDB), etc.
* **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production to encrypt data in transit.
* **Password Hashing**: Passwords must be securely hashed on the backend (e.g., using bcrypt) before storing.
* **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `npm audit`.
* **Error Messages**: Avoid exposing sensitive system details in error messages to the end-user.

---

## 💾 Backup Strategy

Data backup is critical and primarily a **backend and database administration responsibility**.

* **Database Backups**:
  * If using MongoDB Atlas, automated backups are usually available.
  * If self-hosting MongoDB, implement regular automated backups using `mongodump`.
  * Store backups securely in a separate location (e.g., cloud storage).
  * Define a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO).
* **Application Code**: Version control (Git/GitHub) serves as a backup for the codebase.
* **Configuration Files**: Ensure `.env` files and other critical configuration are backed up securely (though `.env` itself should not be committed to Git).

---

## ❗ Cautions & Important Notes

* **Environment Variables (`.env`)**:
  * The backend `.env` file is crucial. Ensure it's correctly configured and **never commit it to version control**. Use a `.env.example` file as a template.
* **Super Admin Role**: The `super-admin` account has extensive privileges. Access to this account should be tightly controlled.
* **Data Integrity**: While client-side validations exist, robust server-side validation is paramount to maintain data integrity.
* **API Rate Limiting**: For production, consider implementing rate limiting on the backend to prevent abuse.
* **Dependencies**: Keep project dependencies up-to-date to leverage new features and security patches. Run `npm audit` periodically.
* **Hardcoded Values**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information or configuration (e.g., API URLs should ideally come from environment variables for different stages like development, staging, production). The current frontend uses `http://localhost:3000` which is fine for local development.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

This project has a solid foundation. Here are some potential areas for future development:

* **Comprehensive Testing**:
  * Unit tests for components and utility functions (e.g., using Jest, React Testing Library).
  * Integration tests for workflows.
  * End-to-end tests (e.g., using Cypress or Playwright).
* **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate testing and deployment (e.g., using GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
* **Advanced Analytics & Reporting**: A dedicated dashboard for business insights.
* **Real-time Notifications**: For events like quotation status changes or new ticket assignments (e.g., using WebSockets).
* **More Granular Permissions**: Beyond the current roles, allow finer control over specific actions.
* **Internationalization (i18n) & Localization (l10n)**: Support for multiple languages and regions.
* **Performance Optimizations**:
  * Code splitting and lazy loading for faster initial page loads.
  * Memoization and efficient state management for complex components.
  * Backend query optimization.
* **Enhanced UI/UX**: Further refinements to user interface and experience.
* **Offline Capabilities**: Consider Progressive Web App (PWA) features.
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: For enhanced security.
* **Full-fledged Ticket Management Module**: With assignment, comments, history, attachments, etc.
* **Inventory Management Module**.
* **Billing & Invoicing Module**.
* **Audit Trails**: Detailed logging of all significant actions for security and compliance.
